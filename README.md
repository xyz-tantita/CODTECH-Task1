OVERVIEW of Project:
Project: Exploratory data Analysis on Titanic Dataset

Objective:
       The objective of this project is to perform Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on a Titanic dataset to uncover insights into the data's characteristics, distributions, correlations, and outliers. Key aspects include exploring demographic trends (e.g., age, gender), socio-economic indicators (e.g., class and fare), and survival outcomes. This analysis aims to provide a deeper understanding of the factors influencing passenger survival and any notable patterns or anomalies in the data.

Key Activites:
     1. Data Exploration: Explored key variables like Survived, Pclass, Age, Sex, and Fare using Pandas.
     2. Data Cleaning: Tackled missing data in the Age and Cabin columns, making the dataset analysis-ready.
     3. Numerical Operations: Leveraged NumPy for handling calculations and imputations.
     4. Visualization: Created impactful visuals with Matplotlib and Seaborn, such as:
                       Count plots to compare survival rates by gender.
                       Box plots to identify fare outliers.
                       Heatmaps to unveil correlations between numeric features.
     5. Outlier Detection: Spotted anomalies in Fare distribution.
     6. Distribution Insights: Histograms highlighted passenger age trends, with many aged between 20-30.

 Technologies Used:
     1. Python:The primary programming language for data analysis
     2. Pandas: Explored critical features like Survived, Pclass, Age, Sex, and Fare.
     3. NumPy: Played a key role in numerical operations and addressing missing values, especially in the Age column.
     4. Seaborn & Matplotlib: Helped craft insightful visualizations to better understand the data.
